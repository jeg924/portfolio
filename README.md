# gamecms-frontend

I want to create a contest system for my last semester at BJU. Because the semester is coming up pretty quickly, I think it will be more effective if I hire the job of producing the frontend out to someone who has more experience in React than me (you). I'm not looking for a fully-featured website, just a basic skeleton and some components I can use to continue to build the website.

The contest that I want to create really takes after CodinGame's style: submit some code that will play a small game and then a recording is passed back to the user. The user will be able to see a recording of their bot's performance and will be able to debug it by looking through its `stdout` and `stderr`.

### Goals:

- Nice, clean look
- VSCode (and maybe a Mac) feel

### Examples that I'm looking at:

- [BJU's Contest System](https://contests-dev.nathantheinventor.com/static/problems.html)
- [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/onboarding)

### Components I Want

- A code editor
  - look at CodinGame's editor for an example
  - base on [Monaco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react)
  - language dropdown
  - props:
    - `resource`: `string` -

### Pages I Want

- Login Page
- Main Page
- Rankings Page
- IDE Page

### Other Stuff I Want

- Global CSS styling
  - text
  - backgrounds
  - colors
-
